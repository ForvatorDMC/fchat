## FAQ

Q: What MySQL module is this using? 

 A: This addon requires a module called mysqloo

Q: Why am I getting Black & Purple instead of the icons? 

 A: If you have fastdl you need to sync it. Some hosts do not sync the "addons" folder, in this case you will need to move the "materials" and "resource" folder from the "fchat" folder into your garrysmod root folder. The root folders is where your "gameinfo.txt" is located.

Q: Can you add feature X? 

 A: Add me on steam and we can discuss it.

Q: Where is the data stored if I do not use MySQL? 

 A: If you do not use MySQL the addon will default back to "SQLite". The data is stored in a file called sv.db and is located in your garrysmod root folder.

Q: Where do I setup usergroup titles & icons or MySQL? 

 A: You go in-game and open up the chatbox. Click on the cogwheel icon that is located in the bottom-right corner of the chatbox. From here you will have to scroll down until you find the buttons. If you do not see these buttons you will have to change your usergroup to one that is considered to be the rank of a superadmin.
